    <h3>How to Make a Bunny Cake</h3>
<p>This bunny cake is so simple to make for Easter,</p>
   <p> using two coconut cakes shaped to look like a bunny head!</p>

   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <h5>Cake:</h5>
   <ul>
    <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix</li>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
    <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
   </ul>

   <h5>Frosting and Decoration:</h5>
 
   <ul>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) container vanilla frosting</li>
    <li>3 ¾ cups flaked coconut</li>
    <li>30 small jellybeans</li>
    <li>4 sticks red licorice</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>Steps</h3>

   <ol>

    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease the sides and bottoms of two 9-inch metal springform pans.</li>
    <li>Beat cake mix, water, vegetable oil, and eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed until moistened, about 30 seconds. Increase to medium speed and beat for 2 minutes. Pour into the prepared pans.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out clean, 23 to 28 minutes.</li>
    <li>Cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then remove cakes from the springform pans and cool completely, about 20 more minutes.</li>

    <li>Cut 2 convex-shaped ears from each side of the second cake, and place them on each side of the head to form ears. Place the remaining concave-shaped piece about 1/2 inch below the head for the bowtie.</li>
